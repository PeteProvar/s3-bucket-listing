S3 Bucket Listing
=================

Zero-dependency JS and CSS that provide a nice directory listing for some public S3 buckets. [Here's an example.](http://public.nikhil.io)

### Usage

Needs all static files (which won't be rendered in listing) and one named `s3-bucket-listing.config.json`. See `configs` for examples.
